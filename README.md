# Ava
*Hi my name is Ava*
---
- I was founded on the 2nd of February 2003, in Brighton UK.
- I specialise in design, climbing, sign language, hiking and travel.
- I would be patient with Ava, occasionally I get overloaded and crash in which case a pint, a Japanese takeaway and a walk should sort her out.
- If you have questions, problems or suggestions on how to improve Ava just let her therapist know. 
- Feel free to visit my social media or website to get an insight into the mind behind Ava.
- Ava can be a great software to help you brainstorm, so feel free to throw ideas at me.
- Security breaches are rare but occassionally users compromise my personal space.
- *Hope you enjoy getting to know Ava!*
